Stuff that we can do:
- Moving Targets
- Enemy flashing red when hit 
- I think atleast 3 different weapons should be good (Sword, Longbow, Shield)
- Damage Numbers
- Simple AI for an enemy 

Stuff thats a stretch (mostly if we have the time for it):
-  I don't know how hard it is but we could maybe add like sounds to things
-  Different types of enemies
-  Im iffy on the shield but theres prob some way to make it block hits
-  Having to reload the longbow
